*Goals*: 
-> Draw the thrust lines
	At each rotor
	What do I have:
		The coordinates of the arms of the quad


-> I need the normal to the quad plane
	At each iteration, I have 3 quad points
	So, I can get the normal to the quad plane. And I do

	Now, draw a line 
	At every frame rendering, update (x, y, z) or rotation and scale, so that line is parallel to normal

	So, for line:
	(x,y,z) can originate at center of quad
