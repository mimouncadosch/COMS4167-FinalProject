<h1>3-D Quadcopter Simulation in JavaScript using Three.js</h1>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
  In recent years, the increasing supply of smartphones has driven down the cost of electronic components and sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. As a result, quadcopters can now be more easily controlled with the help of onboard sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless connections to base. Not surprisingly, the popularity of these vehicles has boosted in the past few years.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to implement a three dimensional simulation of a quadcopter in JavaScript. The library used for visualizing this simulation in three dimensions is <a href="http://threejs.org" target="_blank">Three.js</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	My motivation, beyond this simulation, is that the same control systems designed for this simulation can be applied to real-world quadcopters, for programmable (and hence autonomous!) flight control.
</p>
<h3>Setup and kinematics</h3>
<p>
  First, let's describe the setup of this project as well as the kinematics of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is defined in two different spaces, the inertial space and the body space. The position and velocity in the inertial space are defined as:
</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 	x \\ y \\ z \\
\end{bmatrix}
&& \dot{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
 	\dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, in the body frame, the position and velocity of the quadcopter are given by:
</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
\theta = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	\phi \\ \theta \\ \psi
\end{bmatrix}
&& \dot{\theta} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	\dot{\phi} \\ \dot{\theta} \\ \dot{\psi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
</p>
<p>
  To be specific, $\phi$ corresponds to the roll, $\theta$ to the pitch, and $\psi$ to the yaw of the quadcopter. These correspond to the angular position of the quadcopter relative to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. The state of the system can thus be given by $q = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \theta \end{bmatrix}$ and $\dot{q} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{\theta} \end{bmatrix}$.
</p>
<p>
The rotation matrix $\textbf{R}$ gives us a way to go from the body space to the inertial space. In other words, if we have a vector $\vec{v}$ in the body frame, this vector is $R \vec{v}$ in the inertial space. R is given by:
</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
R = 
\begin{bmatrix}
cos_\phi cos_\psi-cos_\theta sin_\phi sin_\psi & - cos_\psi sin_\phi - cos_\phi cos_\theta sin_\psi & sin_\theta sin_\psi\\
cos_\theta cos_\psi sin_\phi + cos_\phi sin_\psi & cos_\phi cos_\theta cos_\psi - sin_\phi sin_\psi & -cos_\psi sin_\theta\\
sin_\phi sin_\theta & cos_\phi sin_\theta & cos _\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
</p>

<h3>Quadcopter Dynamics</h3>
<h4>Magniutde of Motor Thrusts</h4>
<p>
As a heads-up, here I use the words "motor" and "rotor" interchangeably. Our purpose here is to find an equation describing the magnitude $T$ of the force produced by a rotor. These magnitudes are key in calculating the motion of the quadcopter through time, and will help us understand its movement through space. Quadcopters use brushless motors, numbered 0 through 3 in this simulation. Each rotor creates torque, which is given by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	\tau = K_qI	
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
where I is the current through the motor, and $K_q$ is the torque constant. Torque is responsible for producing the thrust that will make the quadcopter move. The voltage going through the rotors is given by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	V = R_\alpha I + K_e\omega
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
where again, $R_\alpha$ and $K_e\omega$ are rotor-specific constants, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity of each motor. Therefore, in steady state, the power of each rotor is given by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	P = IV = \frac{\tau}{K_q}  R_\alpha I + K_e\omega \\
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>By making a series of simplifications not relevant to this simulation (as we are not dealing with a real-world quadcopter!), we can approximate P by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	P \approx \frac{K_e}{K_t}\tau \omega
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
Now, conservation of energy gives that the energy consumed by the rotor in $\delta_t$ is equal to the thrust generated by the rotor times the velocity of the air. 
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	P = T v_h
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
Here, we assume that the quadcopter is flying at reasonably low speeds, so $v_h$ is the velocity of the air when the quadcopter is in hovering mode. Momentum theory further relates hover velocity to thrust by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	v_h = \sqrt{\frac{T}{2\rho A}}
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
We can thus write:
</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
P &= \frac{K_e}{K_t} \tau \omega = \frac{K_v K_\tau}{K_t} T \omega = \frac{T^{3/2}}{2 \rho A}
\end{align}
</p>
<p>
 And, finally, we obtain an equation for the thrust of a rotor:
</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
	T &= \Big(\frac{K_v K_\tau \sqrt{2 \rho A}}{K_t} \omega\Big)^2\\
	T &= k \omega^2
\end{align}
</p>
<p>
where k is a constant used to simplify the system, combining all the other system constants. The important information here is that the magnitude $T$ of the rotor thrust is quadratic in the angular velocity $\omega$ of the rotor.
</p>
<p>
The total thrust force on the quadcopter, applied at its center of gravity (the center of the frame, intersection of the quadcopter's arms) is:	
</p>
<p>
\begin{equation}
T_B = \sum_{i=1}^{4} T_i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \sum \omega_i^2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
</p>

<h4>Torques in the directions of the body frame angles</h4>
<p>
For each motor, we can write the torque it produces about its axis of rotation. For $i = {\phi, \theta, \psi}$, we can write:
</p>
<p>
\begin{equation}
	\tau_{axis} = b \omega^2 + I_M \dot{omega}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
where $I_m$ is the moment of inertia about the rotor's axis, $\dot{\omega}$ is the angular acceleration of the propeller, and $b$ is the drag coefficient of the air. The values of vector $\textbf{\tau_B}$ correspond to the torques around the $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ axes.
</p>
<p>
	\begin{align}
	\tau_B = \begin{bmatrix} \tau_{\phi} \\ \tau_{\theta} \\ \tau_{\psi} \end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix} lk(- \omega_2^2 + \omega_4^2) \\ lk(-\omega_1^2 + \omega_3^2) \\ \sum_{i=1}^{4} \tau_{M_i} \end{bmatrix}

	\end{align}

</p>
<p>
Here, we have made the following design choices: rotors 1 and 3 are in the roll axis (x), rotors 2 and 4 in the pitch axis (y). l corresponds to the length of the arms of the quadcopter (distance between the center and any one propeller). b is the drag coefficient.
</p>

<h4>Motion</h4>
<p>
Finally, this is where all the derivations we have done so far get in handy. Indeed, we will use the thrust magnitudes and torque values to calculate the motion of the quadcopter through time. Before we start, Let's define the global drag forces as $F_D$, which is a force proportional to the velocity of the quadcopter. The expression for $F_D$ is given by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	F_D = -k_d \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
where $k_d$ is the friction constant, and $\dot{x}$ is the velocity vector in the inertial frame, as previously defined. With this, we can write our equation for the motion of the quadcopter, as given below:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{align}
	m\ddot{x} &= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -mg \end{bmatrix} + RT_B + F_D \\
	\iff
	\ddot{x} &= \begin{bmatrix} 0\\0\\-g \end{bmatrix} + \frac{RT_B + F_D}{m}

	\end{align}
</p>
<p>
	Having the equations of motion in the inertial space is nice, but it will be even more useful to have the equations of motion in the body space of the quadcopter. For this purpose, we need Euler's equations for rigid body dynamics. Euler's equations give us:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{align}
	I \dot{\omega} + \omega \times (I \omega) = \tau
	\end{align}
</p>
<p>
Where $I$ is the inertia matrix, $\omega$ the angular velocity vector of the quadcopter, and $\tau$ the total torque $\tau_b$ previously calculated. Since the quadcopter has a symmetric structure, with the arms aligned in an X-shape, the inertia matrix $\textbf{I}$ is diagonal and given by:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{equation}
	I = \begin{bmatrix} I_{xx}&0&0\\ 0&I_{yy}&0&\\ 0&0&I_{zz} \end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
	From this, we derive the following expression for the angular acceleration of the quadcopter:
</p>
<p>
	\begin{align}
	\dot{\omega} &= \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\omega_x} &\dot{\omega_y} &\dot{\omega_z} \end{bmatrix} 
		= I^{-1}(\tau - \omega \times (I \omega))
	\end{align}
</p>
<p>
We're done! In order to update our system at every timestep, we update the relevant values:
<ul>
	<li>
		$\omega = \omega + \dot{\omega} \Delta{t}$
	</li>
	<li>
		$\dot{\theta}$ is obtained from translating $\omega$ into the inertial frame
	</li>
	<li>
		$\dot{\theta} = \theta + \dot{\theta} \Delta{t}$
	</li>
	<li>
		$\dot{x} = \dot{x} + a \Delta{t}$
	</li>
	<li>
		$x = x + \dot{x} \Delta{t}$
	</li>
</ul>
